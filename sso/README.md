 * HTTPS_SECRET: Name of the Secret to use to expose SSO/Keycloak over HTTPS (defaults to sso-app-secret)
 * HTTPS_KEYSTORE: Name of the keystore to use to expose SSO/Keycloak over HTTPS (defaults to keystore.jks)

##SSO Example

Create Secrets and SSO/Keycloak Server in user (e.g. "myproject") project/namespace:

```
$ oc create -n myproject -f ../secrets/sso-app-secret.json
$ oc process -f sso70-postgresql.json -v HTTPS_NAME=jboss,HTTPS_PASSWORD=mykeystorepass | oc create -n myproject -f -
```

After executing the above, you should be able to access the SSO/Keycloak server at http://sso-myproject.hostname/auth and https://secure-sso-myproject.hostname/auth
